# Stats-For-Data-Science


Statistics is a key element in becoming a **competent** **Data Scientist/ Data Analyst/ Machine Learning Engineer**. To ensure I cover all aspects of the statistical learning, I have embarked on the free course tool provided by **Free Code Camp**.

The link to the course is : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statistics-for-data-scientce-machine-learning-and-ai-handbook/#random-variables

# Steps for using this Repository:

When going through different elements of the link, you will come across a variety of sections. From **Correlation** to the **Centralk Limit Theorem**. When reading a topic, I would recommend you clicking on to the correlated file path.

For example if you are studying **Correlation**, ensure to open up the **Correlation.ipynb** file path in your preferred IDE. This will help you understand the concept and visualise the code side by side.
